    - Use fonts with similar "moods" and "Time Era"
    - contrast on the serif-ness and weights of the fonts
- Probably do not use Comic sans :)

## UI Design
### 1. Hierarchy
Ways to establish hierarchy
1. Colours - make important things stand out
2. Size - bigger items grab attention

### 2. Layout
- optimal lenght of text blocks -> 40 - 60 characters
- chop content into smaller pieces

### 3. Alignment
- reduce the number of alignment points/lines

### 4. White Space
- spacing things out makes items look more elevated

### 5. Audience
- design for your target audience
